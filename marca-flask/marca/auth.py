'''Blueprint is imported and registered from the factory
using app.register_blueprint().

Represents a blueprint, a collection of routes and other app-related functions
that can be registered on a real application later.

A blueprint is an object that allows defining application functions without
requiring an application object ahead of time. It uses the same decorators
as :class:`~flask.Flask`, but defers the need for an application by recording
them for later registration.

Decorating a function with a blueprint creates a deferred function that is
called with :class:`~flask.blueprints.BlueprintSetupState` when the blueprint
is registered on an application.
