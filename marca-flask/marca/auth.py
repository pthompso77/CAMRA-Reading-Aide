'''Blueprint is imported and registered from the factory using app.register_blueprint().

Represents a blueprint, a collection of routes and other app-related functions that can be registered on a real application later.

A blueprint is an object that allows defining application functions without requiring an application object ahead of time. It uses the same decorators as :class:`~flask.Flask`, but defers the need for an application by recording them for later registration.

Decorating a function with a blueprint creates a deferred function that is called with :class:`~flask.blueprints.BlueprintSetupState` when the blueprint is registered on an application.
